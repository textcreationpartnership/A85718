            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>M. SPEAKER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no Courts of Judicature within this Kingdome of England, but have ſeverall rights and priviledges apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and belonging unto them: and have ſuch power and authority in the ſeverall juriſdictions of the ſame, that they may call to an account, proſecute, and bring to judgement the infringers and breakers of the ſame. Of all theſe Courts there is none, yea put them all together, they are not of ſuch power and juriſdiction, but inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and ſubject to the Ordinances and Statutes of the high Court of Parliament.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> Of ſuch awfull predominance is the very name of a Parliament to this Nation, that it ſtrikes with terrour and deſpaire all ſuch evill doers as are malefactors in the State: on the contrary ſide, it cheares and comforts the drooping Spirits of men groaning under the burthen of tyrannicall oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion inflicted on them unjuſtly and maliciouſly by
<pb facs="tcp:111877:3"/>
unmercifull and wicked men that have uſurped to themſelves places and offices of power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> This great and high Court is not only the powerfulleſt of all other Courts whatſoever, but the prudenteſt and wiſeſt, made and compacted not onely of men ſound in Religion, well learned, but ripe in their judgments, contracted from all parts of this Kingdome, elected and choſen with the free conſent of the whole body politique of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. This great and high Councell is not onely of ſuch power and wiſdome, but endowed and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the moſt and greateſt priviledges of all others; yea, ſo great are the priviledges thereof, that not onely the meaneſt of his Majeſties Subjects, but the greateſt perſonages of the Kingdome are in danger, if infringers of the ſame, to be called in queſtion and by them puniſhed therefore. Give me leave M. Speaker, to ſpeake ſomewhat of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges in particular, incident and appertaining to this wiſe Senate: and in ſpeaking thereof, I ſhall obſerve theſe three particulars: firſt, the rights and priviledges belonging to the ſame, in the free votes and judicature thereof. Secondly, the rights and priviledges belonging to the power and juriſdiction thereof; and thirdly, the rights and priviledges in the continuance thereof, being freely called and aſſembled by his Majeſties royall authority, not to be diſſolved or broken off till all things agitated therein for the good both of Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, be fully concluded and determined.</p>
            <p>Firſt, M. Speaker, concerning the priviledges of a
<pb facs="tcp:111877:3"/>
Parliament belonging to the free votes and judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, I ſhall obſerve theſe particulars: firſt, to ſpeake freely without interruption or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in any debate, diſpute, or argument, upon any buſineſſe agitated in the ſame being a member thereof, I conceive to be one priviledge of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, not to be queſtioned, for any ſuch free diſpute, argument, or debate, to be taxed or accuſed for the ſame, either during the free ſitting thereof, or after, is another priviledge of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, freely to give vote, judgement, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, upon the reading of any Bill, to be made a law, or any bill, either of Attainder, or other charge againſt Delinquents and Criminous perſons of the State at their triall upon the ſame, is a third privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to defend and maintain, the free votes, judgements, and ſentences of the whole Houſe, by Proteſtation, Remonſtrance, or other Declaration, if not conſented unto or oppoſed by the Houſe of Lords, is a fourth priviledge.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, for any member of the Houſe not to be accuſed of any crime, or impeached for treaſon by any perſon whatſoever, during the continuance of the Parliament for things done in the ſame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out legall accuſation and proſecution of any ſuch member by the whole Houſe, is another priviledge of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, not to be apprehended upon ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, or arreſted by any officer, or to have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch accuſation their Chambers, Trunks, and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb facs="tcp:111877:4"/>
broken open, their bookes and writings ſeazed upon, without conſent or warrant of the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, is another priviledge of the ſame. And thus much Mr. Speaker ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken concerning the priviledges and rites of Parliament, pertinent to the ſubject, of which I am to ſpeake. I come now to the ſecond thing I propoſed to your audience, which was the rites and priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the power and juriſdiction of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: In which I ſhall obſerve theſe particulars. Firſt, to conſult and conſider of what lawes are fit to be made and inacted in this kingdome for the good government thereof, is one priviledge belonging to the power and juriſdiction of this High Court.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to nullifie and abrogate, repeale, make voide, to ratifie and confirme, eſtabliſh, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine lawes, ſtatutes, and ordinances, made and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by precedent Parliament, by Councels of State, or other Courts of judicature, is a ſecond priviledge pertaining to the power and juriſdiction of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to give ſubſidies, to raiſe taxes, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe loanes and other charges upon the ſubject, is another priviledge belonging to the power and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to accuſe or impeach any Incendiaries or Delinquents in this kingdome of any crime no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, tending to the prejudice of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty or any of his loyall Subjects, whether it be for treaſon or otherwiſe, be they members of the Parliament or no, is another priviledge belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the power and juriſdiction of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:111877:4"/>Fifthly, and laſtly, to proceed and bring to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuch perſons ſo accuſed or impeached for any crime whatſoever, is another priviledge belonging to the power and juriſdiction of this Court, and thus much of the rites and priviledges belonging to the power and juriſdiction of a Parliament.</p>
            <p>And now Mr. Speaker, I come to the laſt things I mentioned to you, concerning the priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the continuance and free ſitting till all things be concluded of for the good government both of Church and ſtate, in which I ſhall alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe particulars. Firſt, that for a Parliament when freely called and aſſembled by royall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not to be tyed to debate, or argue any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular buſineſſe appointed by any perſon whatſoever, is one priviledge belonging to the free continuance of a Parliament.</p>
            <p>Secondly, not to break off or diſſolve a free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, untill all the grievances and oppreſſions of all his Majeſties loyall ſubjects bee fully redreſſed and remedied, is a ſecond priviledge belonging to the continuance of a Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, not to breake off or diſſolve a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till all Incendiaries and Delinquents in the ſtate be brought to condigne puniſhment for their crimes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, not to accuſe or impeach any member of the Parliament thereby to hinder and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the legall proceedings thereof in the waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affaires of the Common-wealth, is another privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge belonging to the continuance of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:111877:5"/>And thus Maſter Speaker, having briefly declared unto you the power and juriſdiction of a Parliament above all other Courts of Iudicature in this land, the wiſdome and policy of a Parliament above all other Councels, the rights and priviledges of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in reſpect of the free votes and judicature thereof, the power and juriſdiction thereof, and the free continuance thereof; I humbly leave to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this Houſe, whether the accuſation of theſe Gentlemen accuſed by his Majeſty, and the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legall breaking open upon this their accuſation, of their Chambers, Trunks, &amp; ſtudies, be not a breach of ſome of the Priviledges of Parliament which I have mentioned unto you.</p>
